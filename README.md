# Frontend Mentor - Fylo dark theme landing page

This is a solution to the [Fylo dark theme landing page challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/fylo-dark-theme-landing-page-5ca5f2d21e82137ec91a50fd). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects. 

# Update 
I tried to make a fixed header. The background is transparent on the desktop version, but on mobile it has the same dark blue background as the main part, because otherwise it breaks the rest of the page.
